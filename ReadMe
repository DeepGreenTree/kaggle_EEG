To use this for training, you should do the following:
	1. Generate the eeg_train.npy and eeg_test.npy with read_data.py
	2. Write your own model file in models with Lasagne grammar like the example models in there, e.g. resize3_c1r4p5_f9n128r35p1_v67.py, len2560p1_resize3_bs_c1r4p5_f9n128r35p1_v67.py, len4096_downsample4_resize3_bs_c7p7_f9n128_r35p1_v67.py
	3. Start to train your model with the command below (take the resize3_c1r4p5_f9n128r35p1_v67 model for example):
    		THEANO_FLAGS=device=gpu0,floatX=float32 python train_net.py resize3_c1r4p5_f9n128r35p1_v67
			(Note: this is for GPU-available device only)


For details of model parameters, go to models/resize3_c1r4p5_f9n128r35p1_v67.py
